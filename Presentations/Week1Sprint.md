### ReferWell 

Doctors routinely refer patients to specialists. 

---
#### The process
In order to make the referral, the doctor needs to 
1. Identify the most appropriate specialist,
2. Collect relevant information from the patient's health record
3. Inform the patient about the referral

---
#### The Pain Point

Existing EHR-based referral systems generate generic letters that lack personalization, leading to inefficiencies (e.g., mismatched specialists, incomplete data), patient confusion, and administrative burden.

---
#### Solution Direction
ReferWell is a multi-agent referral management system designed to streamline the healthcare referral process. The initial focus is on simplifying the **identification of appropriate specialists**, **generating a referral report** with key data tailored to the specialistâ€™s needs, and **creating a personalized letter for patients** explaining the reason for the referral.
